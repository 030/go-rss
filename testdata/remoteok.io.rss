					Part Time User Experience Designer 				</title>
								<company>Better.</company>
												<description>Join Better. A small, remote team of passionate web and app developers that are changing the world through code. We partner with some exciting startups that are redefining healthcare, education and more. You can learn more about our agency and projects on [our website](https://withbetter.com/)This is an application for an ongoing contract, remote designer role. The minimum hours required is 16 hours per week. However, we can offer up to 32 hours per week of ongoing work.  This is a perfect opportunity for someone who is looking for a flexible job with a lot of freedom. Or someone who is looking to augment and extend their consulting work with a stable ongoing contract. All work is asynchronous first, work whenever, however you want. Rarely have to do a real time meeting. You'll be implementing projects paired with developers.  A very unique opportunity to iterate quickly and get designs in the world fast.Currently we only have one designer / developer on the team and we have a backlog of features and designs that need work. ### About the jobDay to day is grabbing a user story, doing the research to understand the context and provide user interface recommendations to the development team. Then, work with the development team to refine those ideas continuously. As an agency we work with lots of different product spaces and verticals. Healthcare, education and more across the Web and Mobile. * All project specific communication is done through Github, ideally you have direct experience with it although this doesnât disqualify you. We can help you learn that. * Most other company communication happens through our slack channel. Youâll have at least an every other week 1:1 thatâs real time with your team lead. * Lots of collaboration, mockups and prototyping back and forth with project managers and developers. * We donât have great design processes in place, itâs something we need some help with. * Currently all of our designs are in Sketch - youâll need to be competent in sketch, however we are thinking of transiting to figma in the future to facilitate collaboration. * We lean heavily on CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. Ideally you have a solid understanding of component based design systems ([example](https://blog.bitsrc.io/building-a-consistent-ui-design-system-4481fb37470f)), however, this doesnât disqualify you. * You donât need to know any code, but any technical or code knowledge could prove helpful in your day to day job. At least an understanding of how HTML and CSS work to make recommendations the development team can understand and implement. ### About youWe need people who have strong intrinsic motivation to build great things. Managers of One is a concept we really embrace that comes from Basecamp. We need people who are always learning, excited to solve hard problems and always eager to do great work. Ideally someone who has experience in: * Direct experience or training in Designing WebApps and Mobile Apps. * This is primarily a user experience design position, although there may be some small more graphic design driven projects. (Re-working logos, help with marketing), although this would be the exception. ### Pay &amp; benefitsThis is an ongoing part time hourly contract position. * Pay will start at $30 / hr.* As a result there is no health or other traditional benefits. * However, we do offer online course sponsorship and we'll buy you ebooks that will help you be a better designer through our learning + book club. * As well, we offer time off bonuses that accrue at a rate of 5%. Works out to roughly 2 paid weeks a year. Itâs nice to be able to take a paid day or a week off even when you are a contractor. </description>

You have enough experience building the web to appreciate the right tool for the job, so hate threads about PHP are usually of a waste of your time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You've spent at least a few years on the Linux command line administering public facing servers. &amp;nbsp;You know where to find all the different logs, the stuck SQL queries, what's killing the CPU, what IOPS are and why they matter. &amp;nbsp;You can teach your boss how to create a systemd service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with stalwart open source tools like Munin and Nagios, as well as commercial solutions like New Relic and Loggly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You like to talk about caching and performance at length.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You don't think using Git from the terminal is hard at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have an intermediate amount of experience with AWS, Azure, or GCP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You know what containers are and why they're an important technical development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're great with people and can speak conversationally on any of the above topics with non-technical &quot;business types&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll be reporting to the Director of Customer Care who has extensive background with each of our current Technical Accounts in the US and will bring you up to speed. &amp;nbsp;You'll be accountable for 6 to 10 active enterprise customers with a wide range of projects and needs so strong organizational skills are a nice to have, but not strictly required. &amp;nbsp;What's most required is your curiosity and your enthusiasm for helping people solve their problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fully remote position. &amp;nbsp;Prior experience with fully remote work is not required, but a command of written communication is the key to your success in this role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

					Senior Front End Engineer				</title>
								<company>Treasure Data</company>
												<description>&lt;p&gt;The Console team is a small group of JavaScript engineers working on a complex and modern web app which is growing fast. Our team looks to build solid user experiences for our customers on top of an unparalleled platform using the newest tech. We're growing a lot over the next few years, and we're looking for self-starter engineers who want to add to our team atmosphere and bring their own experiences and personalities to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we do:&lt;/strong&gt; We are very proud of our technology stack and processes and will look to you to help maintain and extend them. You'll have the freedom to leave your mark on the codebase, as well as discuss new and better ways to accomplish our goals. Stay up to date with current developments in the JavaScript world and discuss them with your team. We often run spikes of new technologies or approaches to see how they change our developer experience in the codebase. The primary product you will work on is a large React web app, built on a cutting-edge processing platform that helps our customers store, access, and analyze huge quantities of data at much less expensive than a conventional data infrastructure operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are just a few features we're proud of:&lt;/strong&gt; We stay ahead of the curve on updates and frequently have upgrade cycles to keep adding new features delivered by our dependencies. We believe in testing and expect unit tests with our pull requests. Tests are run on every push to GitHub and are required to pass before merging a PR. Our development environment has a lot of features that make development easier, and automation saves everyone time Hate arguing about tabs and spaces? Common-sense linting rules and a code prettifier means you won't have to think about style rules while coding anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who You Are and Why You Belong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you like talking about JavaScript and architecture? Are you passionate about learning new technologies and skills? When you see a new library come out, do you immediately wonder how you can use it for work? Your significant expertise with modern JavaScript frameworks (MVC or variations), previous experience on large web application development, and understanding of the importance of testing when it comes to production-quality code will make you shine among us. You&amp;rsquo;re committed to quality and take persistent pride in the code you write.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are as enthusiastic about Open Source as we are. You may even have contributed to a project. Include whatever information you believe shows off your skills: GitHub profile, code samples, links to personal projects, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you're not local, there's no need to worry; we all work remotely. Slack, GitHub, and Zoom video calls are your go-to apps to keep up face-to-face contact with your teammates and the rest of the company. Daily standups with weekly retrospectives and planning sessions help you keep pace and let you give feedback regularly. We also regularly schedule a yearly meetup for in-person discussions and planning. This meetup also includes fun events like team dinners, a hackathon, and a weekend trip.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You'll Need To Succeed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two or more years experience building web applications or similar web experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong familiarity with React and its ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with ESNext and modern JavaScript features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A strong testing ethic with experience using a test runner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Willingness to bring new ideas to the table&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You'll Get From Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A remote-friendly and exciting work environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opportunities for professional development, from leadership to evaluating new technologies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with specialists in varied fields, from designers to product managers, to make a world-class product used by major international companies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Experience with remote developers is a huge plus but not mandatory. &amp;nbsp;Demonstrated experience in a startup or large company environment to get things done.&amp;nbsp; You see yourself as a technical enthusiastic but you love when your team succeeds on a project and personal level. &amp;nbsp;Watching people grow excites you and you want to see that hands on. &amp;nbsp;We also know that many amazing developers can be excellent managers and managers can are excellent developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some signs of a great candidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance recognized by your peers.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Past colleagues would love to work and report into you again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical expertise with people passion. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Your passion is helping your teams to the state of knowing what to do, why it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing and facilitate the process to arrive on how it should be done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eager to help. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;You often identify a problem, create a solution to help the team overcome any objections. &amp;nbsp;You love helping others on cross-functional teams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciation of honest feedback.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity.

When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You know you can&amp;rsquo;t get it done on your own. &amp;nbsp;Depending and trusting on others is something you&amp;rsquo;ve learned or do right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diligent, but pragmatic.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we are different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our main goals with Motiion are easy to explain: We want to build a company that we would like to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;enjoy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;spending the rest of our careers in, that has a positive impact on the world and that will outlast us. Achieving these goals will be challenging, but we know we can do it. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strong founder team&lt;/strong&gt; We, the founders, have a proven track record of building successful companies from scratch. We will take all of the amazing and painful experiences of the past and apply them to create a company we all will be very proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-funded&lt;/strong&gt; The founders have invested $10 million to allow us to focus on building technology and product the right way. Our eyes are on the goals of building a global technology platform. We are laser focused on customer needs, but will make product priorities based on our long-term goals, not short-term revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote-first&lt;/strong&gt; We believe technology that enables remote work to be&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;than a corporate office setting is already here and the world of business is just about to catch up. Remote work certainly comes with drawbacks, but the strongly believe the advantages vastly outnumber the disadvantages. Speaking to dozens of experienced remote employees has shown us that the number one obstacle to building a successful remote workplace is doing it half-way by having some people be co-located and some remote. We want the same mode of collaboration for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and our team will be working remotely most of the time. This does not mean that you have to work from home all the time, or at all. Motiion will pay for co-working space if that&amp;rsquo;s what you prefer. We will also encourage team members that live in the same area to meet up and work together when it makes sense. We will also make sure we all meet regularly for real in-person interaction!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal impact of collaborating individuals&lt;/strong&gt; We have seen first-hand how corporate culture can devolve into empire building and reporting lines. Motiion will have great managers, but we recognize and value the skills of individual contributors. You can grow your career at Motiion doing the work you love and excel at. Your merit matters, not your title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt; We have top notch benefits, matching most of the large US tech companies, including 401k matching, excellent health insurance and a generous vacation policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

												<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Development Mentors &amp;amp; Tutors (Node.js &amp;amp; Javascript) (f/m/d)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We created CareerFoundry to help others build their careers while maintaining personal freedom and flexibility. Our 100% online, flexible, mentor-driven courses are setting the standard for globally accessible technical education. Through our online programs, expert Tutors and Mentors bring students from complete beginners to junior web developers in 6 months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are looking for experienced and passionate web developers all over the world to join our Mentor and Tutor pool and help define the next generation of tech talent by educating and empowering students across the globe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our global pool of over 180 Mentors and Tutors in web development, user experience design, and user interface design fields has grown to include freelancers, entrepreneurs, consultants, and tech leads who passionately guide, motivate, and empower our students to create new careers in the tech industry. We are constantly searching for more teaching enthusiasts like you to join this pool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being a part of our Mentor and Tutor team is more than teaching. It is inspiring newcomers to the field to build, to problem solve, to think like a developer, and to increase their value as professionals. With their expertise from the field, Mentors and Tutors provide guidance and encouragement to their students each step of the way, from writing their first line of code to polishing their first professional App portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are currently recruiting for two roles: Mentor (3+ years experience) and Tutor (1-3 years experience)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Mission as Mentor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most students will be beginners and are looking not only for a Mentor&amp;rsquo;s help and experience to master the necessary skills, but also inspiration and motivation to keep them focused and motivated along the way. You're their link and their point of entry into their new industry, so they want to hear that they'll be able to make it (if they put in the work, of course).&lt;br&gt;As a Mentor, you will be reviewing your students&amp;rsquo; work on regular basis with a view to how it would fit into an industry-ready portfolio. Additionally, you will do one-on-one video calls to help prepare your students for their entry into their new industry. They&amp;rsquo;re going to want to know how you got your start in the industry, how you network, how you decide which companies and roles to go for, and much more!&lt;br&gt;To succeed in this role, you need to have a real drive to pass on your wisdom and secrets for success to the next generation of developers. After working with their Mentor and Tutor on their main course, they will work with a dedicated Career Specialist who will help them through their job search phase - but we look to you to help encourage the mindset they will need to enter their new industry.&lt;br&gt;Mentors communicate with students through Slack and our in-platform messaging tool and respond to students within 48 hours of receiving an assignment submission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you will be doing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;During your time at CareerFoundry you will equip students with the tools to become career-ready through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reviewing student &quot;achievements&quot; submitted through the CareerFoundry platform (a portfolio-ready piece of work coming at the end of a number of smaller exercises).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advising the student specifically on career-related topics and helping prepare them to enter the industry through one-on-one video calls with each student.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggesting supplemental learning materials and personal insights in areas where students are struggling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with a Tutor who will review work on a daily basis and answer day-to-day enquiries - you'll be on hand to step in for more advanced queries or for a higher level of troubleshooting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in it for you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remuneration - Mentors will sign a freelance contract and will be compensated on a monthly basis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexible and Mobile - Work from anywhere with an internet connection and with a schedule that works for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fulfilling - Directly impact students&amp;rsquo; personal growth and help them succeed in their goals. Contribute to your industry and help shape the outlook of the next generation of developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Mission as Tutor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tutors give feedback and constructive criticism on assignments and provide students with the guidance they need to improve their work through reviews and industry insights. Once a student submits an assignment, Tutors make sure that it meets all the requirements set out by the course curriculum, marking to rubrics we provide with each task to ensure students meet a consistent standard.&lt;br&gt;When students are struggling with understanding a key area, Tutors are there to encourage them and provide supplemental tricks and tips to help them power through any roadblocks they encounter. Your job as a Tutor is not to hold a student&amp;rsquo;s hand, but to help them learn the troubleshooting and problem-solving skills they&amp;rsquo;ll need to work as a developer.&lt;br&gt;Tutors communicate with students through Slack and our in-platform messaging tool and respond to students within 24 hours of receiving an assignment submission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you will be doing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;During your time at CareerFoundry you will equip students with the tools to become career-ready through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regularly reviewing student exercises submitted through the CareerFoundry platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code reviews and checking for fundamental understanding of concepts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggesting supplemental learning materials and personal insights in areas where students are struggling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with a Mentor who will advise the student specifically on career-related topics and support you as a Tutor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in it for you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remuneration - Tutors will sign a freelance contract and will be compensated on a monthly basis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexible and Mobile - Work from anywhere with an internet connection and with a schedule that works for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educational - Deepen your own knowledge of web development by teaching it to others and benefit from a Mentor&amp;rsquo;s advice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fulfilling - Directly impact students&amp;rsquo; personal growth and help them succeed in their goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;R&amp;eacute;sum&amp;eacute; Gold - Mentoring and teaching experience is highly sought after by employers everywhere.&amp;acute;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are passionate about sharing your knowledge and experience, supporting students on their way to becoming web developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have several years&amp;rsquo; experience as a web developer in Javascript and Node.js, with a demonstrable track record showcasing your work for a variety of clients and companies.

					Senior Rails Engineer				</title>
								<company>Jilt</company>
												<description>Howdy ðWeâre the folks at Jilt, an email marketing platform built for eCommerce. We help thousands of stores surprise and delight their customers with emails that drive sales. Weâre looking for a driven, detail-oriented engineer to join our team and build fast, scalable backend systems in Rails.**The Role**Youâll work closely with your teammates on the engineering team to design, create, and refine systems that power the core platform; things like syncing data with external eCommerce platforms, optimizing our sending architecture &amp; scheduler, and analyzing browsing &amp; shopping behavior data. Jilt is built as a traditional Rails 5.2 app, with Postgres &amp; Elasticsearch for persistence, and Sidekiq for background jobs. We use Angular (v1) to power our visual email editor and Vue.js for some areas with a lot of dynamic content, and are actively replacing both with React, so youâll be able to help architect the APIs that will drive those new interfaces.While the majority of your time will be spent working on backend systems &amp; features, youâll also have the opportunity to work on various front-end systems, like fixing a bug with our email editor, replacing a legacy Slim template with a React view, or adding a new feature to our storefront JS.As one of our senior engineers, the team will look to you for advice and direction. Youâll help shape our best practices, decide on libraries &amp; tooling, and refactor older or underperforming parts of the codebase. Youâll also be responsible for moving your projects forward, communicating your progress and milestones with others, and clearly documenting your work.**Here are some things you may do on a given day:*** Research and write a pitch to improve the performance of our email scheduling system* Refactor our storage subsystem to abstract how we handle file uploads* Troubleshoot an issue with our campaign segmentation feature by deep diving into our Elasticsearch cluster* Analyze a slow SQL query and suggest ways to improve it* Construct a detailed, multi-step data migration to split an existing model into two, with zero-downtime and including complicated data transformations* Triage the Sentry queue for any exceptions that need investigation* Develop a new API endpoint to support updated React components**On the first day you will:*** Meet your team and get familiar with how we work* Setup your local environment and tooling* Commit a small tweak to the codebase and ship it to production**In the first week you will:*** Develop, QA, review, and ship a small feature improvement* Participate in code review for a teammateâs code* Help a team member with fixing a bug**In the first month you will:*** Work closely with the product team to ship a large feature* Participate in your first support rotation week and help our support team with escalated issues* Publish a retrospective on your first large project to share successes &amp; planned improvements for the next project**Who youâll work with:*** Justin Stern, CTO - Youâll work with Justin to deeply understand our codebase, and learn how the various parts of our systems work together.* Beka Rice, Head of Product - Beka will help you learn our platform, in detail, and all the ways that our customers use Jilt.* Youâll also work with the rest of the product &amp; engineering teams (Ivan, Lucas, Jonathan, Wes, Artan, Jared, Chase) to review one anotherâs work and collaborate on projects.**You****To succeed in this position, you should have:*** Deep experience &amp; proficiency in Ruby &amp; Rails* Demonstrated ability to break larger epics out into smaller discrete stories with detailed implementation tasks* Experience working on the front-end and excitement for combining front-end frameworks like React alongside Rails* Familiarity working with external APIs (have experience with eCommerce platforms? This is a bonus â tell us!)You love writing code thatâs clear, self-documenting (but you know that self-documenting doesnât mean no comments), and standards-compliant. You prefer writing Ruby, but are comfortable in JavaScript or picking up other languages (like Go or PHP) as needed. You have deep experience working with Rails and all of its libraries and know when to roll a custom solution to a problem or use a gem. Youâve worked with Sidekiq or a similar background processing system, and understand the subtle but important guidelines to follow when architecting performant, fault-tolerant background workers.You also love data and working with complex queries in SQL, whether as part of ActiveRecord or on the console. You have experience with Elasticsearch, or are excited to learn it, and are interested in the challenges involved with keeping separate datastores in sync. You love keeping up-to-date with the latest best practices and tools, and are constantly tweaking and improving the way you work. You know how to operate a hydraulic press, or least watched a YouTube video about them and think theyâre totally rad.Youâre excited to solve engineering challenges in the most pragmatic way possible, and most importantly, you keep the end user in mind and love getting feedback from customers to help improve our products.Finally, you canât wait to join a small team that loves their work as much as you do, affords the opportunity to work on challenging &amp; interesting projects, continuously learn and improve, and constantly ship your work. Youâre an excellent writer and can communicate effectively whether drafting up a bug report, chatting in Slack, editing a wiki page, or drafting a retrospective. You know that code is about communication and explaining your thought process clearly goes hand-in-hand. Our team is fully-remote and we communicate primarily through Slack, Clubhouse, Google Docs, Basecamp, and weekly stand-ups via Zoom (a few short meetings) â we believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time thatâs free of distractions.As a remote team, we believe that regular meetups are invaluable for getting to know each other better, so you should be available for 1-2 company-paid team trips per year. Curious about what those are like? Check out our recap of our last team retreat (SkyTrip), which brought the entire team out to Lake Tahoe, California for a week. Itâs a plus if you think (like we do) that bears are absolutely the coolest animals in the forest. This is a full-time, salaried position, but hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with commits, issues closed, and wiki edits.**Process**After an initial screening, youâll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, youâll have a few 45 minute phone chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company. The most qualified candidates will then be invited to complete a short one-day research project. If this goes well, we'll invite you to the final stage of our evaluation process: the trial project. During this ~2 week period, you'll work closely with your future manager, as well as a few other team members, as a paid contractor to implement your proposal from the research project. You'll be welcomed in Slack, introduced to any team members you may be working with, and will have regular chats with your future manager to share feedback and make sure all is going well. This brief trial period is a great way for you to make sure you enjoy the work and the team, and it also gives us an opportunity to do the same. At the end of the period, assuming a great experience for all, you'll be offered a full time position ðThen the real fun and full onboarding experience will begin! ð**Benefits**Here are some benefits we're happy to offer to our team members:* Competitive salary* 27 days of paid time-off, in addition to 2 company holidays (SkyVerge Day in March, Founders Day in June ð)* Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for non-US/Canadian residents)* 401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for non-US/Canadian residents)* 8 weeks paid parental leave for new mothers and fathers* Work flexible hours from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection* Tools (hardware/software) to help you be productive* Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)* Home office or co-working allowance* A Kindle to help you keep learning*We support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class. We believe when we work together as a team of different views, experiences, and ideas, we can build amazing things.*</description>

Our team's family time is important; we won't typically require long hours when we can avoid it, which is almost always. Our entire team works remotely using Slack for casual interaction, &amp;shy;so you can live practically anywhere in the World if you have an Internet connection. There's no micro&amp;shy;management here&amp;mdash;we trust that you will see tasks through to completion and communicate with your fellow team members when needed or ask for help when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Defiant, &amp;lsquo;trust&amp;rsquo; is the attribute we value most highly among our team members. We need to know that you can grab a task from a support ticketing system, communicate clearly with our customers, and see the task to completion with superb attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You Are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Willing to grab whatever task is required of you and run with it.

You should be able to comfort customers and de-escalate stressful situations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You Have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good understanding of WordPress as a CMS and PHP application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;General knowledge of Internet protocols, web tools, programming languages and security infrastructures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent analytical ability and problem solving skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Problem solving and critical thinking. Ability to perform advanced troubleshooting and guide customers through the same. Ability to search information and evaluate it independently, or present hypotheses to coworkers for input.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;On screen multitasking. You will be working in several different interfaces at once and must be able to effectively answer customers and communicate with coworkers over the course of the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fast and reliable internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Information:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;All positions require a trial period of approximately 2-3 weeks with a minimum commitment of 10 hours per week. You will be paid for this short-term contract, and it will be used to evaluate whether both parties want to pursue an ongoing, regular employment relationship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;All offers of employment are contingent on successful completion of a background check. The results of the background check are considered as they relate to the position and do not automatically disqualify someone from a offer of employment with the company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

No, it&amp;rsquo;s not a high IQ. And no, it&amp;rsquo;s not that they studied more than the rest of us at school. There are a whole host of attributes that these people embody, which are never taught in school. Things like perseverance, passion, laser-like focus, a positive mindset, and the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avanoo exists to help employees at Fortune&amp;nbsp;1,000 companies embody these attributes, through 3-minute-a-day video programs and deep analytics that help us understand what their people need the most and predict what sort of content can drive the most impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the skills we learn in school are the applications we use to get through life, the attributes we help people embody at Avanoo are like the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We're doing quite well&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just completed our series A round of investment, grew more than 3x over last year, and unlike many companies in Silicon Valley, we're profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've proven over and over again that we can help enterprises drive real impact to their bottom line just&amp;nbsp;through the magic concoction we've put together.

You strive to find long-term solutions when you can, but can compromise when you have to. &amp;nbsp;You love getting to know new customers and learning the intricacies of their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some signs of a great candidate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organized.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Your calendar is always up to date and you&amp;rsquo;re rarely late to anything. No task you take on gets lost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep technical understanding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This is not a programming position, but you might have been a developer at some point before you decided to be more customer focused.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Although you&amp;rsquo;re organized, you understand that our customers might not be. You know how to get people to get things done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance recognized by your peers.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Past colleagues would love to work with you again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starter and finisher.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - alone or with collaborators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work hard and smart.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Your work ethic is unquestioned, and you know how to get things done so you can balance your work and personal life in a sustainable way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disciplined and reliable.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You know that your team members&amp;rsquo; perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to make the team perform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciation of honest feedback.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You feedback given to as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytical and practical mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we are different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our main goals with Motiion are easy to explain: We want to build a company that we would like to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;enjoy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;spending the rest of our careers in, that has a positive impact on the world and that will outlast us. Achieving these goals will be challenging, but we know we can do it. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strong founder team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, the founders, have a proven track record of building successful companies from scratch. We will take all of the amazing and painful experiences of the past and apply them to create a company we all will be very proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-funded&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders have invested $10 million to allow us to focus on building technology and product the right way. Our eyes are on the goals of building a global technology platform. We are laser focused on customer needs, but will make product priorities based on our long-term goals, not short-term revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote-first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe technology that enables remote work to be&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;than a corporate office setting is already here and the world of business is just about to catch up. Remote work certainly comes with drawbacks, but the strongly believe the advantages vastly outnumber the disadvantages. Speaking to dozens of experienced remote employees has shown us that the number one obstacle to building a successful remote workplace is doing it half-way by having some people be co-located and some remote. We want the same mode of collaboration for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and our team will be working remotely most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that you have to work from home all the time, or at all. Motiion will pay for co-working space if that&amp;rsquo;s what you prefer. We will also encourage team members that live in the same area to meet up and work together when it makes sense. We will also make sure we all meet regularly for real in-person interaction!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal impact of collaborating individuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have seen first-hand how corporate culture can devolve into empire building and reporting lines. Motiion will have great managers, but we recognize and value the skills of individual contributors. You can grow your career at Motiion doing the work you love and excel at. Your merit matters, not your title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have top notch benefits, matching most of the large US tech companies, including 401k matching, excellent health insurance and a generous vacation policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We are consistently recognized as a great place to work based our outstanding leadership and dedication to company culture, and are looking for the best people to join our incredible team spread across more than 35 countries! We value ownership and innovation, and we build our teams with that in mind. We want each team to be responsible and accountable for what they ship but we don't want to reinvent the wheel. Our philosophy to achieve this is relying on excellent tooling and automation over policies and processes, creating a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ricomariani/the-pit-of-success-cfefc6cb64c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pit of success&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that naturally gets teams to align in terms of practices and technologies. That is the Auth0 Platform (internal PaaS): a set of internal tools and services that development teams use to make their life easier when shipping their features. As we continue to grow, we are creating new teams that own more specific parts of Auth0. To encourage and simplify operational ownership, we will be splitting our existing services into smaller, more decoupled ones that separate teams will own. At the same time, we want to allow new teams that are forming to quickly be able to go from development to production in a reliable way and following recommended practices. Teams should be able to set up core pieces like observability, reliable deployment mechanisms, secure communication channels, database access and capacity planning with minimal overhead required from their side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define and share the vision for a cloud Platform that is scalable, reliable and secure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Product Managers and Engineering teams to build Auth0's internal PaaS in order to enable other development teams to build on Auth0's vision of &quot;conquering the world one login box a time.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spend time working with internal customers to understand their needs and sell them on the Auth0 platform&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement features across different teams using technologies such as AWS, GCP, Azure,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://node.js/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;, MongoDB, Postgres, Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might be good for this role if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have experience building PaaS and IaaS platforms that are running in production (either Public or Private).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have walked the road of evolving monolithic systems into a service oriented architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design and architect large scale distributed systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constantly strive to hit the right balance between simplicity and flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a great ability to collaborate with multiple teams and get consensus on a vision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have great empathy for customer's needs and continuously iterate on your understanding of a problem space based on their feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are passionate about building reliable, secure, scalable services collaborating with multiple teams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have 10+ years of software development experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have 3+ years of experience working on cloud applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred Locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;GMT-Americas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about our hiring process&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://auth0.com/blog/how-we-hire-engineers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

												<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driver Growth @Heetch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're a thoughtful, talented, full stack and distributed product team consisting of backend, mobile, frontend and QA engineers, as well as product managers and product designers. We're responsible for the acquisition, engagement, and retention of all our drivers .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our multi-disciplined team allows us to work autonomously across the realms of our scope. This means we own our roadmap entirely, and we empower each team member to contribute and influence what we work on and how. Our mission is quite simple;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Deliver Driver happiness and ensure they get the optimum experience that they deserve&lt;/strong&gt;. Drivers use and rely on the products we build every single day to earn a living. This is a responsibility that we hold dear and do not take for granted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SRE within Driver Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our infrastructure receives 2.5 millions of events per day and processes 100M of API requests. We also serve over a dozen thousand rides, have a Driver signup funnel with 50 separate Data fields and process hundred of gigabytes of log and interaction data daily. Our team owns upwards of 20 microservices on top of Elixir, Kafka and Docker, and are focussing our efforts on adding to this number as we extract from our legacy codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply; The services we support and the code we produce are critical to the business. Be it a potential driver going through our acquisition funnel, an active driver entering our marketplace or a driver viewing their earnings and account details to name but a few, the impact our backend engineers have on the business as a whole is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Values&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;Transparency:&lt;/strong&gt; we discuss everything openly within the team.

					Product Designer				</title>
								<company>Jilt</company>
												<description>Howdy! ðWeâre the folks at [Jilt](https://jilt.com/about/), an email marketing platform built for eCommerce. We help thousands of stores surprise and delight their customers with automated emails that drive sales. Weâre looking for a driven, detail-oriented UX designer to join our team and build streamlined experiences that delight our users.**The Role**Youâll work closely with teammates on the product and engineering teams to evaluate and improve our user experience via thoughtful design. Our customers are business owners or eCommerce store administrators, so itâs important to us to design experiences that get out of their way, make email marketing fun and approachable, and help them understand best practices. Youâll be responsible for identifying areas of improvement and contributing to customer research, prototyping solutions to these problems, then working on a development-ready visual design.While the majority of your time will be spent working on wireframes and visual design, youâll also have the opportunity to contribute to customer development and research, pitching new features or improvements, and building the design standards for our growing team.Weâve worked with long-term contractors for product design thus far, so as our first full-time design hire, youâll influence design standards and patterns that we use as our team grows. Youâll help shape our best practices, workflows, and visual standards. Youâll also be responsible for moving your projects forward, communicating your progress and milestones with others, and clearly documenting your work (we try to have good documentation on why weâve made previous decisions for new team members to reference). As a remote-first, 100% distributed team, great communication and internal artifacts are vital to our success.**Here are some things you may do on a given day:*** Participate in interviews with new or active users* Watch Hotjar recordings to evaluate current UX / usability* Develop pitch documents for new features or improvements to existing ones* Provide feedback on designs and pitches from other team members* Create wireframes or low-fidelity prototypes for new features (we like Figma for all design projects, but weâre always open to trying new tools)* Test prototypes or designs with users and team members to validate design concepts* Design production-ready prototypes to hand to our engineering team* Work with the development team to add or update UX components within Storybook* Iterate on designs in a sprint team to respond to technical needs with engineering team members* Work closely with other product team members to draft and prioritize stories for development within Clubhouse (never seen Clubhouse? Totally okay!)* Update our team wiki as our design standards evolve* Contribute to designs for our marketing site (which we treat as a product, and should have consistency with our app)**On the first day you will:*** Meet your team and get familiar with how we work* Setup your local environment and tooling* Add a new story for a design improvement youâve identified**In the first week you will:*** Add wireframes and detailed design to your new story* Participate in review for a teammateâs pitch or design* Contribute to improvements for our onboarding course and design documentation based on your experience**In the first month you will:*** Work closely with the product team to ship a large feature (working through initial designs and iterating on them during development)* Publish a retrospective on your first large project to share successes, artifact the reasoning behind decisions we made, and add planned improvements for the next project**To succeed in this position, you should have:*** Experience designing for the web (while you donât have to be an expert, you should have an eye towards ensuring accessibility, developing reusable components and patterns, etc) * Ability to juggle multiple deadlines at once* An obsession about streamlining user experiences and with delighting the user* Familiarity with HTML and CSS (have experience with JavaScript or written your own code? This is a bonus â tell us!)**Who youâll work with:*** Beka Rice, Head of Product - Youâll work with Beka to understand our product in detail and learn all the ways that our customers use Jilt.* Max Rice, CEO - Max is very hands-on and on some projects youâll work with him on designs for our product or our marketing site.* Youâll also collaborate with design contractors to review one anotherâs work and collaborate on larger projects.**About you**You love designs that are un-designed, but that add some pieces of flair that make software fun to use. You know that great design requires an exceptional level of empathy, and you work hard to understand the problems your designs will solve. You know that design isnât great unless itâs functional and understandable. Your favorite question is, âWhy?â You know that all software design is subject to technical constraints, so working with the engineering team closely during a build helps you both work towards an amazing user experience while still questioning the limitations of what is possible.You love keeping up-to-date with the latest best practices and tools, and are constantly tweaking and improving the way you work. Youâre curious and excited to learn, so adopting new tooling or digging into a new app is something youâre keen to tackle. (After all, it is a new experience for you to learn from!) You know how to operate a hydraulic press, or at least watched a YouTube video about them and think theyâre totally rad.Youâre excited to solve usability challenges in the most pragmatic way possible, and most importantly, you keep the end user in mind and love getting feedback from customers to help improve our products. Youâre excited to contribute to both the planning and execution of new features and improvements.Finally, you canât wait to join a small team that loves their work as much as you do, affords the opportunity to work on challenging &amp; interesting projects, continuously learn and improve, and constantly ship your work. Youâre a great writer and can communicate effectively whether drafting up a pitch document, chatting in Slack, editing a wiki page, or drafting a retrospective. You know that design is about communication and explaining your thought process clearly goes hand-in-hand. You can communicate fluently in English, or at least as close as anyone can come to fluent English, because really, itâs English.**Process**After an initial screening, youâll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, youâll have a few 45 minute phone chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company. The most qualified candidates will then be invited to complete a short one-day research project. If this goes well, weâll invite you to the final stage of our evaluation process: the trial project. During this 2-3 week period, youâll work closely with our team as a paid contractor to implement your proposal from the research project. This gives you an opportunity to make sure you enjoy the work and the team, and it gives us an opportunity to evaluate your work. Weâll have regular chats each week to share feedback and make sure weâre on the same page. At the end of the project, if all goes well, youâll be offered a permanent position. ð **Benefits**Our team is fully-remote and we communicate primarily through Slack, Clubhouse, Google Docs, Basecamp, and weekly stand-ups via Zoom (a few short meetings) â we believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time thatâs free of distractions.As a remote team, we believe that regular meetups are invaluable for getting to know each other better, so you should be available for 1-2 company-paid team trips per year. Curious about what those are like? Check out our recap of our last team retreat ([SkyTrip](https://www.skyverge.com/blog/skytrip-2018-recap/)), which brought the entire team out to Lake Tahoe, California for a week. Itâs a plus if you think (like we do) that bears are absolutely the coolest animals in the forest. You can see what the team has to say about working with us [here.](https://hq.skyverge.com/working-at-skyverge/)This is a full-time, salaried position, but hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with wireframes and prototypes created, stories drafted, and wiki edits.Here are some benefits we're happy to offer to our team members:- Competitive salary- Annual incentive for meeting team and company goals- 27 days of paid time-off, in addition to 2 company holidays (SkyVerge Day in March, Founders Day in June ð)- Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for non-US/Canadian residents)- 401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for non-US/Canadian residents)- Up to 8 weeks paid parental leave for new mothers and fathers- Work flexible hours from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection. Weâre a remote-first company and embrace working asynchronously.- Tools (hardware/software) to help you be productive- Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)- Home office or co-working allowance- A Kindle to help you keep learning*We support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class. We believe when we work together as a team of different views, experiences, and ideas, we can build amazing things.*</description>

Specifically you have at least a good basic understanding of containers and you have an excellent understanding of &amp;nbsp;HTTP (please don&amp;rsquo;t submit your CV if you can&amp;rsquo;t tell a 301 from a 404, and we do expect you to at least know about TLS).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent knowledge of Git: you rebase like a god and you do not lose consciousness when you hear &amp;ldquo;bisect&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should have a good grasp of relational databases (Postgres / MySQL), caches (Redis), Search-Engines (Elastic Search, but if you &amp;ldquo;only&quot; have some Solr chops, we won&amp;rsquo;t complain), Message Queues (any really, but we provide RabbitMQ and Kafka) and how they fit into an architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should have a good understanding of deployment workflows and some of the DevOps tooling (stuff like Puppet and Chef, anything from Hashicorp).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Published technical articles or presentations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience giving presentations or trainings, eg. at conferences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

As the company behind the popular open source projects &amp;mdash; Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats &amp;mdash; we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. Diversity drives our vibe. We unite employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Cloud runs primarily in public cloud environments like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, allowing customers to provision and scale Elastic clusters in a turnkey fashion. In addition to our Software-as-a-Service solution we're working on bringing this same simplicity of deployment and automation to customers who want to run and manage multiple Elastic clusters on-premise (in their own data centers).You will be contributing significantly to both initiatives. You will also be integral in crafting the products we build, not just implementing specs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you a front-end developer, ready to work on Cloud, our Elasticsearch-as-a-service product offering?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, we'd love to talk. To get a feel for some of the things we work with, take a look at this blog post by one of our team members. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/blog/color-coded-visualizations-react&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.elastic.co/blog/color-coded-visualizations-react&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've read this far and think, &amp;ldquo;that's me!&amp;rdquo; then you probably won't need to read any further and we should have a conversation. But if you are in any doubt about the kind of experience we are looking for, and the role you can expect at Elastic, then the following bullet points should help clarify;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you will be doing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will innovate, lead and contribute to the development and user experience of both our hosted and on-premise offerings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will work closely with the Elastic Cloud Product, Operations and Engineering teams to define and shape the tasks we work on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assist in designing a scalable cloud offering working across everything from a few Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances to many thousands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you've done:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least a year of web application development experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worked or experimented with React&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to work with a worldwide team in a distributed work environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enthusiastic about JavaScript or web development in general&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Competitive pay and benefits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Passionate people building great products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employees with a wide variety of interests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distributed-first company with employees in over 30 countries, spread across 18 time zones, and speaking over 30 languages!

												<description>&lt;p&gt;Quimbee is growing! Were looking to add a new full-time member to our core team. &lt;strong&gt;This position is 100% remote (U.S. only)&lt;/strong&gt;. All you need is an internet connection and a quiet place to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who We Are&lt;br&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quimbee is one of the most widely used e-learning platforms for law students in the United States. Simply put, our mission is to help law students get A's in their law school courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, Quimbee has helped over a hundred thousand law students prepare for classes and final exams. We provide law students with access to a comprehensive database of case summaries, video lessons, practice questions, a legal dictionary, and a growing library of content. We have become one of the most widely used and trusted sites for law students, serving both institutional clients, such as Yale University, American University, and University of Illinois, as well as thousands of individual law students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We prefer a small and highly effective engineering team, so every new team member is vital to the success of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Were Looking For&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for our first site-reliability engineer (SRE). As our SRE, you must have &lt;strong&gt;strong experience with Ruby on Rails based applications&lt;/strong&gt;. Ideally, you're an experienced Ruby on Rails developer with a passion for operations tasks. Your focus will be on improving our deployment practices, maintaining, troubleshooting, documenting, and improving the systems that keep our &lt;strong&gt;Heroku hosted system&lt;/strong&gt; running securely and smoothly with the least downtime possible. Eventually, we might also consider alternative hosting platforms in the future, and we expect you to help with that too. There will be a lot of monitoring, alerting, and prioritizing what is worth our attention and what's not. You're expected to investigate and mitigate single points of failure, performance bottlenecks, slow SQL queries, errors, or any other identified issues trying to solve them yourself or with the help of the other developers in the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll have the opportunity to help us define and shape processes, tools, and best practices in the context of our platform. You'll work closely with our team of developers to determine the current state of our platform as well as defining the future of it. Strong candidates will bring strong engineering and operations acumen, combined with the ability to move fast (and fix things).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're looking for collaborative, detail-oriented people who are ready for a challenge. In this role, you'll be responsible for working on the critical task of ensuring our backend systems are rock solid and scalable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youll join a small, 100% remote tech team&lt;/strong&gt;. Your voice will be heard when we need to make new technical decisions as our product grows. We expect you to go beyond coding to give input on the product roadmap, design, and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A Ruby developer&lt;/strong&gt;. You have deep  software engineering experience and are comfortable writing code in Ruby  as well as at least one other programming language.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A DevOps advocate&lt;/strong&gt;.  You believe in the benefits of immutable infrastructure and understand  what it takes to implement it from the operating-system level up to  datacenter deployments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A data-driven engineer&lt;/strong&gt;. You know the difference between an MTTR and MTTD and have the skills necessary to optimize them.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A great process and code debugger&lt;/strong&gt;.  You feel comfortable leading robust and thorough root cause analysis  (RCA) sessions to attack problems at their core and ensure they dont  recur.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A self-starter&lt;/strong&gt;. You take responsibility for  projects from idea to completion, proactively seeking assistance as  needed while guiding the work to successful outcomes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A versatile engineer&lt;/strong&gt;.  You know what you dont know and feel comfortable learning new skills.  Youre not ashamed of recognizing mistakes and take measures to avoid  falling again.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A team player&lt;/strong&gt;. You share code ownership as much as possible. You don't mind fixing other peoples code or stepping in to help a teammate.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A minimalist&lt;/strong&gt;.  You believe a new feature should be built only when the evidence  supports it. Youre willing to push back when you believe this rule is  being ignored or violated.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A great communicator&lt;/strong&gt;. You  communicate your ideas, feedback, and criticism thoroughly, clearly, and  courteously. You believe theres no such thing as over-explaining or  over-clarifying because thats how miscommunication is avoided.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A business-minded engineer&lt;/strong&gt;. You have a deep understanding of the importance of building maintainable, efficient, clean code while balancing that with the urgency of the business needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with us, you could be asked to (solo or as part of a team):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create  and maintain documentation about our platform and all the third-party  services it depends on, defining a plan of development for failover  mechanisms to improve our platform's resilience.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Investigate  issues reported by our automated systems or our customer support or QA  teams, determine impact and root cause, then prioritize and document  them, and solve them yourself when possible or sync with our devs team  to solve it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Streamline our deployment process so that deployments are  as smooth as possible both for our users as well as for our teams,  considering the possibility of having to rollback.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Educate  engineers throughout the company on how to ensure their projects meet  our reliability, performance, and security requirements.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reduce the server-side and front-end latency of our application to deliver a lightning-fast user experience.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Optimize  our hosting bill by increasing throughput and resource efficiency,  while planning capacity for the next two years of growth.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Determine  and configure a core set of metrics and alerts to make sure our apps  and servers are running smoothly and that we can react fast if something  bad happens.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain performance and load tests.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Possible on-call responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Offer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Join a small team who loves what they do.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;100% remote work for unlimited flexibility.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A competitive salary.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Untracked paid time off and sick leave.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Healthcare coverage (including dental) for you and your family.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;401(k) with 3% company matching.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description>
